# `corona.py`

A Python script that tries to provide up-to-date data about the Coronavirus outbreak. It scrapes the [Worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) site for information. So, the information should be accurate. However, I'm not to be held responsible for any inaccuracies should they exist.

The output is colored, tabulated and easily understood.

## Dependencies

`corona.py` depends on:
